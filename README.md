# AlgorithmAnalysisProject

Introduction
This project conducts theoretical analyses of the performance of various sorting algorithms, including Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Heap, Merge, Quick, Counting, and Radix sorts. The aim is to understand the impact of input data properties on the performance of these algorithms in best, average, and worst-case scenarios. This analysis provides deeper insights into the nuances of each algorithm, extending beyond conventional performance expectations.

Approach
The project was structured into manageable components to efficiently meet all requirements. The approach involved:

Coding Requirements Analysis: Determining the coding needs and structuring the codebase for clarity and maintainability.
Modular Codebase: Using multiple files for different functionalities:
A file containing the sorting algorithms.
A file dedicated to creating arrays for testing (best, worst, average cases).
A main file for array creation, algorithm execution, and timing.
Data Storage and Analysis: Experimental data, along with graphs, were maintained in a separate Excel file, details of which are discussed in the results section.
How to Run
Clone the repository or download the source code.
Compile the source files using a C++ compiler.
Run the executable and follow on-screen prompts to execute different sorting algorithms.
Results
The results, including detailed analyses and graphical representations, are stored in an Excel file accompanying this project. These results offer valuable insights into the performance characteristics of each sorting algorithm under various conditions.

Contributing
Contributions to enhance the analysis, extend the range of algorithms, or improve the implementation are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
